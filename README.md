We propose **DKUX-Net**, a transformer-based network for Medical Image Segmentation with less model parameters.

 ## Installation
 Please look into the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for creating conda environment and package installation procedures.

 ## Training Tutorial
 - [x] LA 2018
 
 (Feel free to post suggestions in issues of recommending latest proposed transformer network for comparison. Currently, the network folder is to put the current SOTA transformer. We can further add the recommended network in it for training.)

## Training
Training and fine-tuning instructions are in [TRAINING.md](TRAINING.md). Pretrained model weights will be uploaded for public usage later on.
